                  Jake Mehew’s Binaural Brainwave Simulator explores the
                  intersection of sound, vision, and neuroscience through
                  modular synthesis and digitally-coded visuals. The work delves
                  into the musical potential of combination tones, creating
                  immersive auditory and visual illusions. These illusions aim
                  to rhythmically entrain the audience, producing psychoacoustic
                  tones in the listener analogous to natural brainwave states.
                  This innovative performance bridges art and science, offering
                  a unique sensory experience.

                <h4>NikNak | Ireti</h4>
                <p>
                  NikNak is an award-winning multidisciplinary artist, DJ, and
                  turntablist known for her innovative approach to sound. Her
                  work, including the immersive album Ireti, weaves together
                  elements of afrofuturist storytelling, experimental textures,
                  and deeply atmospheric soundscapes. Combining turntablism and
                  field recordings, she crafts experiences that transport
                  listeners to otherworldly realms. Ireti explores themes of
                  resilience, identity, and hope, offering a powerful and deeply
                  emotional sonic journey.

              The SOUND/IMAGE Research Centre investigates the disruptive
              potential of sound and new media technologies to counter
              established ocularcentric perspectival bias. It brings together an
              interdisciplinary team of musicians and sound designers, film
              makers, scientists, architects, artists and philosophers to
              critically reflect upon the relationships between the auditory and
              the visual, in ways that deliver insight to effect real world
              change.

              The symposium takes the form of a set of talks from invited
              speakers about their creative work with audio programming,
              representing a range of audio programming languages, artistic
              practices, and domains of practice. Each speaker will talk for
              around 45 minutes about their work, with the opportunity for
              attendees to ask questions after each talk.

              HYBRIDY is a multimedia installation composed of audio,
              video-dance and vibrotactile feedback, which explores the
              hybridisation processes between body and nature, instinct and
              technology, biology and algorithms, vibrations and sounds. The
              work draws inspiration from the figures of dryads — half-woman,
              half-tree nymphs of Greek mythology. The dance is intertwined with
              dynamics of fungi, roots and blooms, the video transforms real
              images into abstract compositions and the sound-vibration dialogue
              explores the liminal spaces between organic, analogue and digital.
              A symbiosis of entities that invites “solidarity with non-human”
              (Humankind, T. Morton), fighting against the predominance of one
              entity over another — Reason over Body, Human over Nature,
              Algorithm over Biology.

            </p>
            <p>
              "Rauschen" - white noise - is the totality of sounds. At the same
              time the maximum and the minimum of information. The maximum, as
              everything always. The minimum, as infinite redundancy.
            </p>
            <p>
              In all the pieces of Weiss/weisslich 27 - in correspondence to
              white light - the spectrum of white noise is refracted into
              partial spectrums. In a way the sum of these partial spectrums
              results furthermore in being "white" (everything). The difference
              between (distinguishable) partial spectrums and their
              (indistinguishable) sum is the subject of these pieces.
